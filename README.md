# Mizar Pro unofficial Marlin Firmware
```diff 
-NOT YET TESTED!-
```

This code is suitable for Geeetech Mizar Pro 3D printer.
This code is a merge of stock firmware Marlin 2.0.7 released by Geeetech and the lastest release of Marlin 2.1.x

In addition, in this repository is available also the official firmware released from Geeetech for the UI and you can customize your own fonts and icons or modify them into your favorite UI interactive logic.

If you plan to make changes to the source I suggest you do a pull request as well, so I'll update it for other people as well, but I ask you to keep the source code more similar to the official version of Marlin.
